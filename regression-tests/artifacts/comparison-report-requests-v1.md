## Attempt Details

| Model | Attempt | Outcome | Stop reason | Agent time | Verified time | Output tokens/s | Contract tests | Generated tests | API fee | Input / output tokens |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |

Output tokens/s is total provider-reported output tokens divided by summed completed model-request wall time (excluding tools and verification); n/a means usage was unavailable. Rates are approximate and may not be directly comparable across tokenizers/providers. Times are runner wall-clock seconds. API fees are estimates from recorded usage; unknown means usage was incomplete. Local API fees exclude hardware and energy costs.
